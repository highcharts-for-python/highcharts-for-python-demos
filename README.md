# Highcharts for Python Demos
This is a collection of demonstrations of the Highcharts for Python toolkit.
Fundamentally, they are a Python port of the fantastic demos that Highsoft has
already published for their 
[Highcharts JavaScript library](https://www.highcharts.com/demo).

## How to Use the Demos
First, clone this Github repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:highcharts-for-python/highcharts-for-python-demos.git
```

Next, navigate to its directory:

```
$ cd highcharts-for-python-demos

highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$
````

Create a virtual environment:

```
highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$ python -m venv .venv
```

Then activate your virtual environment:

```
highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate

(.venv)
highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$
```

and install the requirements:

```
(.venv)
highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And finally, open up Jupyter Lab:

```
(.venv)
highcharts-for-python-demos/ (master)
$ jupyter-lab
```

You should now see the set of notebooks included in the repo, along with relevant data files and other details. Browse through the repo, and look at the demos that you want to see. It should be fairly self-explanatory!
